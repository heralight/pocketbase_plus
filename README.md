# Pocketbase Plus ðŸš€

Say goodbye to manual PocketBase model generation and let **Pocketbase Plus** do the heavy lifting! ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation inside your project

install as dev dependency with:


   ```bash
   dart pub add 'dev:pocketbase_plus:{"git":"https://github.com/seifalmotaz/pocketbase_plus"}'   
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   dart pub add dev:pocketbase_plus
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Create a `pocketbase.yaml`** in your project.
2. Fill it with your secret sauce like this:
   ```yaml
   hosting:
     domain: {{YOUR POCKETBASE URL HERE}}
     email: {{ADMIN EMAIL}}
     password: {{ADMIN PASSWORD}}
   ```
4. **Run the magic**: 
   ```bash
   dart run pocketbase_plus:main
   ```
And boom ðŸ’¥! Your models are ready to roll!

Happy coding! âœ¨

## Next Steps

- Support for additional file types.
- Auto-generate CRUD functions directly within the models.
- Implement static `list` functions for fetching multiple records from the model.

More awesome features coming soon... Stay tuned!
